## Final Notes & Best Practices

Each repository follows these guiding principles:
- **Clean Code & Documentation**: Comprehensive READMEs, meaningful variable names, consistent style  
- **Testing**: Unit or integration tests included to validate functionality (where applicable)  
- **Version Control**: Clear commit messages reflecting iterative development  
- **Continuous Integration**: (Optional) GitHub Actions or similar to automate testing and builds
